                The light started to clear shinier, brightier to her. As she approached to the light, she began to think what could depare her once she was into it. She didn't know what was happening. From darkness to lightness, the light appeared from nowhere and started to absorb the whole darkness that surrounded her. As the tried to avoid it, she notices that she couldn't move. She was afraid, at the mercy of the environment. Then suddenly, the light stopped growing up. It started to dim. She knew that it could be her only chance to run away from that nightmare that the darkness made in her mind. She took al the strength that remained inside her and tried as hard as she could to run towards the light
